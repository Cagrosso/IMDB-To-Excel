# IMDB-To-Excel
IMDbPy to Excel spreadsheet

Written for a Database design class project, this Python program uses IMDbPy to pull data on Movies and Actors and place
them into Excel spreadsheets.

Currently, the program relies on a hard coded list of movies to determine what movies are grabbed by IMDbPy.  The program
then goes through a hard coded number actors in the movie, as well as the Director/Directors, Producers, and writers.
